# 📓 MyCodingJournal

*…Report in, Agent.*

This repository is your classified archive — the central hub for all coding operations moving forward.
Every solution you write, every bug you eliminate, and every algorithm you conquer will be logged here as part of your ongoing technical training.

Think of this as your covert command center — 
minus Clover, who still insists the debugger is “haunted.”
